## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Cossacks** are a predominantly East Slavic, Eastern Christian people, 
> originating in the Pontic–Caspian steppe of eastern Ukraine and southern Russia. 
> 
> Cossacks played an important role 
> in defending the southern borders of Ukraine and Russia, 
> countering the Crimean-Nogai raids, 
> alongside economically developing steppe regions north of the Black Sea 
> and around the Azov Sea. 
> 
> Historically, they were a semi-nomadic and semi-militarized people, 
> who were allowed a great degree of self-governance in exchange for military service 
> under the nominal suzerainty of various Eastern European states. 
> 
> Although numerous linguistic and religious groups came together to form the Cossacks, 
> most of them coalesced and became East Slavic–speaking Orthodox Christians.
>
> The rulers of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russian Empire 
> endowed Cossacks with certain special privileges 
> in return for the military duty to serve in the irregular troops: 
> 
> Zaporozhian Cossacks were mostly infantry soldiers, using war wagons, 
> while Don Cossacks were mostly cavalry soldiers. 
> 
> The various Cossack groups were organized along military lines, 
> with large autonomous groups called hosts. 
> Each host had a territory consisting of affiliated villages called stanitsas.
>
> They inhabited sparsely populated areas in the Dnieper, Don, Terek, 
> and Ural river basins, and played an important role 
> in the historical and cultural development of both Ukraine and parts of Russia.
>
> The Cossack way of life persisted via both direct descendants 
> and acquired ideals in other nations into the twentieth century, 
> though the sweeping societal changes of the Russian Revolution 
> disrupted Cossack society as much as any other part of Russia; 
> many Cossacks migrated to other parts of Europe 
> following the establishment of the Soviet Union, 
> while others remained and assimilated into the Communist state.  
> 
> Cohesive Cossack-based units were organized 
> and many fought for both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II.
>
> After World War II, the Soviet Union disbanded the Cossack units within the Soviet Army, 
> leading to the suppression of many Cossack traditions 
> during the rule of Joseph Stalin and his successors. 
> 
> However, during the Perestroika era in the late 1980s, 
> descendants of Cossacks began to revive their national traditions. 
> In 1988, the Soviet Union enacted a law 
> permitting the re-establishment of former Cossack hosts and the formation of new ones. 
> 
> Throughout the 1990s, numerous regional authorities consented 
> to delegate certain local administrative and policing responsibilities 
> to these reconstituted Cossack hosts.
>
> Between 3.5 and 5 million people associate themselves 
> with the Cossack cultural identity across the world, 
> even though the majority have little to no connection to the original Cossack people 
> because cultural ideals and legacy changed greatly with time. 
> 
> Cossack organizations operate in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Canada, 
> and the United States.
