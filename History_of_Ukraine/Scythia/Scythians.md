> The **Scythians** or Scyths, also known as the Pontic Scythians, 
> were an ancient Eastern Iranic equestrian nomadic people 
> who migrated during the 9th to 8th centuries BC from Central Asia 
> to the Pontic Steppe in modern-day Ukraine and Southern Russia, 
> where they remained until the 3rd century BC.
>
> Skilled in mounted warfare, the Scythians displaced the Agathyrsi and the Cimmerians 
> as the dominant power on the western Eurasian Steppe in the 8th century BC. 
> In the 7th century BC, the Scythians crossed the Caucasus Mountains 
> and often raided West Asia along with the Cimmerians.
>
> In the 6th century BC, they were expelled from West Asia by the Medes, and retreated back into the Pontic Steppe, and were later conquered by the Sarmatians in the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC. By the 3rd century AD, last remnants of the Scythians were overwhelmed by the Goths, and by the early Middle Ages, the Scythians were assimilated and absorbed by the various successive populations who had moved into the Pontic Steppe.
>
> After the Scythians' disappearance, authors of the ancient, medieval, and early modern periods used their name to refer to various populations of the steppes unrelated to them.
